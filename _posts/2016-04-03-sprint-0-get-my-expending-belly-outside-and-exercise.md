# Sprint 0 - get my expending belly outside and exercise!

Hey! My name is Carl and I'm creating AI systems at [TheGrid][0]! I'm from [Quebec, Canada][1] and mostly speak french so please forgive me for weird usage of english :) I'm always looking for some ways to push myself so I decided to start this site to share with you those experiments and see what works and what doesn't. 

Tomorrow I'm testing personal sprints. [Sprints][2] are coming from agile software development methodologies. They consist of iterations of a duration of 1 to 2 weeks during which you clarify what need to be done, you do it, you test it, and you deliver it. By delivering small chunks often, we limit the risk of missing the bigger target.

I've been working passionately during the last year but now my body is showing sign of negligence so I've decided that my first 2 weeks sprint would be a "get your expending belly outside and exercice!" 

So my first sprint will consist of: 

* one [7-minute ][3]workout training first time in the morning
* push-ups & abdos before taking a shower in the morning
* 20 minutes of punching bag at lunch time
* 6km-10km jogging around 4PM 

This pretty much respect my natural flow of energy. I'm an early bird, so usually up and running around 6AM. Kicking in with a 7-min workout will ensure a good blood flow and oxygenation of my brain. Should even help me skip a very require coffee in order to start my day! :) 

Push-ups and abdos before showering tone up the body and bring back focus before that relaxing shower. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bbe58eb6-9500-4ccc-a842-634a9d37fc4a.jpg)

20-min of punching bags training at lunch time is not too long to exhaust myself but just perfect to take a break from mental activity and mentally balancing back the flow of thoughts with this intense activity. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e98c5611-baa6-4b96-8685-2f6d68a17449.jpg)

For me the end of the afternoon as always been my intellectual low point of the day! Barely can calculate 2+2! So its the perfect time to get outside for a jogging! Breath fresh air, listen to the latest [Above & Beyond ABGT][4] and concentrate on making one with road!
